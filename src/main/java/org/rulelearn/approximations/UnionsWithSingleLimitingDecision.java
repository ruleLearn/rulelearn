/**
 * Container for all upward and downward unions (i.e., unions of type {@link Union.UnionType#AT_LEAST}, and {@link Union.UnionType#AT_MOST}, respectively),
 * with single limiting decision, that can be defined with respect to an information table.
 * Stores and retrieves unions of type {@link UnionWithSingleLimitingDecision}.<br>
 * <br>
 * Upward/downward unions supplied by this container are sorted from the most specific to the least specific one.
 * For example - if possible values of a decision criterion are: 1, 2 and 3
 * and preference type for this criterion is gain then:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #getUpwardUnions()}[0] yields union "class 3 and better",</li>
 * <li>{@link #getUpwardUnions()}[1] yields union "class 2 and better".</li>
 * </ul>
 * Moreover:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #getDownwardUnions()}[0] yields union "class 1 and worse",</li>
 * <li>{@link #getDownwardUnions()}[1] yields union "class 2 and worse".</li>
 * </ul>
 * If information table contains more than one active decision attribute, then each object is assigned a composite decision
 * (i.e., {@link InformationTable#getDecision(int)} returns {@link CompositeDecision}. In such case, some decisions may be incomparable (mutually non-dominated).
 *  Consequently, unions having incomparable limiting decisions are also incomparable. The order of incomparable unions is arbitrary (i.e., any of the two unions may be
 *  first, followed by the other union).<br>
 *  <br>
 *  Upward/downward unions returned by this union container are defined only for such limiting decisions, that are fully determined (i.e., do not involve a missing attribute
 *  value).
